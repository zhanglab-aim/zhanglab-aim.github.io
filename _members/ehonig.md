I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Statistics at University of California, Los Angeles, advised by [Prof. Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/). My main research interest is modeling and sampling from data distributions, specifically generative modeling and representation learning. I am currently working with Prof. Zijun Zhang on modeling gene expression as part of a system to develop meaningful clinical recommendations, which aligns with my ultimate goal of helping people using downstream applications of deep learning models.
