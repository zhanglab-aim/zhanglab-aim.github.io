Victoria Li is a senior at Hunter College High School who has been studying computational biology with Dr. Frank Zhang 
since the summer after her sophomore year (June 2020). In her project, Victoria created CROTON, a deep learning model 
that predicts CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing outcomes. Victoria’s work can help make CRISPR/Cas9-based experiments and 
therapies more effective, consistent, and equitable. Victoria’s research has been published in the peer-reviewed 
journal Bioinformatics ([https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab268](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab268)),
 and she presented her research at 2021 
ISMB/ECCB, the International Society for Computational Biology’s flagship conference. For her research, Victoria has 
also been recognized as a Top 40 finalist in the Regeneron Science Talent Search, the nation’s oldest and most 
prestigious high school STEM competition.
