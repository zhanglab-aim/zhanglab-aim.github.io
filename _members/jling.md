Justin is a clinical research data specialist in Dr. Zhang’s lab, a part of Cedars-Sinai’s Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.

He completed his M.D. degree at the Medical University of Lublin in Poland, with clinical rotations primarily in Chicago and the surrounding Chicagoland cities. He also has an M.S. degree in Biotechnology and Bioinformatics from California State University, Channel Islands, as well as a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences from UC Irvine.

Justin has worked in neurobiology research labs at UC Irvine, as well as biotechnology and medical device companies such as Baxter Bioscience and Branan Medical Corporation, which is now a part of Alere Inc. Before joining Dr. Zhang’s lab, Justin worked as a content developer and medical illustrator for Osmosis, an online medical education company that is now a branch of Elsevier.

His strong desire to integrate his personal passions for computer science and technology with his education and experience in medicine and biological sciences led him to pursue clinical data science and AI in medicine, which he found to be extremely fascinating. After completing IBM’s certificate in Data Science and the University of Colorado’s certificate in Clinical Data Science he was excited to join Dr. Zhang’s lab where he is working on implementing a knowledge graph for clinical AI utilizing graph data science tools and techniques.


Some of his published work prior to joining the Zhang lab are listed below:
