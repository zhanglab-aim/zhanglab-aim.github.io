I am currently pursuing a PhD at the Data Science and Mining Team of the Computer Science Laboratory at École Polytechnique, under the supervision of Prof. Michalis Vazirgiannis. In 2022, I completed an internship at Flatiron Institute’s Simons Foundation in New York, where I worked on the application of graph neural networks for cancer gene prediction under the guidance of Prof. Zijun Frank Zhang.

My research interests lie in the field of machine learning for graph-structured data, with a focus on developing innovative deep learning architectures for graphs (GNNs) and applying them to real-world problems such as drug discovery and cancer gene prediction. I am also exploring the application of graph representation learning techniques in the fields of AutoML and Neural Architecture Search.
