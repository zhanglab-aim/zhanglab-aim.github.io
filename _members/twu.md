Tinghui is a clinical research data specialist in Dr. Zhang’s lab, a part of Cedars-Sinai’s Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.

She recently graduated with a M.S. degree of Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Stony Brook University in New York. Before that, she has more than 5 years of research experience adapting deep learning methods to detect pancreatic cancer through CT scans at Medical Data Analytics Laboratory, National Taiwan University.

Bridging the gap between different fields has always been her most significant interest. One of the projects she will be working on is to evaluate genomic sequence on training-free Neural Architecture Search. She was excited to join Dr. Zhang’s lab and looking forward to other collaboration opportunities in the future.
