I am currently a Postdoctoral Scientist in the Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine at [Cedars-Sinai Medical Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/), working with Prof. Zijun Frank Zhang. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/) at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/), where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Victor Sheng](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/victor_sheng/index.php). I obtained my MS degree from the University of Texas at San Antonio.

I have a strong interest in and actively contribute to various research areas. These include end-to-end learning of complex modular information processing assemblies, meta-learning (or learning to learn), attention mechanisms, deep generative models, convolutional architectures, natural language processing (with a particular focus on word embeddings, summarization, and language models), graph neural networks, security & privacy, as well as their diverse applications in fields such as text mining, biomedicine, healthcare systems, and gene prediction.
