I am an incoming Assistant Professor in the Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine at the Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center (starting in the Fall of 2022). 

I enjoy exploring the uncharted areas with talented next generations of scientists. 
Technically, I am a methodology person - I like to build things, and computer programming has been my
favorite "artisans workshop".  Leveraging the computational power of artificial intelligence, we are lucky to live and witness
a new era where computations and biotechnologies are growing exponentially, and the opportunities of actionable clinical 
predictions and precision biomedicine are at the dawn of computation-driven scientific discoveries.

Currently I am a Flatiron Research fellow with <a href="https://function.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Olga Troyanskaya</a> 
at Princeton University/Simons Foundation. I obtained my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics with <a href="https://xinglab.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Yi Xing</a> at UCLA, 
with research focus on elucidating the regulatory basis of human transcriptomes. 
While at UCLA, I also pursued a Master's degree in Statistics with <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/"> Dr. Ying Nian Wu </a>, studying automated machine learning and deep learning methods. 
During my undergrad at Zhejiang University, I worked with <a href="http://bis.zju.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Dr. Ming Chen</a> for three years to study the metabolic networks using computational and systems biology approaches.
