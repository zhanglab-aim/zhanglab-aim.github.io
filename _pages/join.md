<a id="undergraduate-student"></a>
#### Undergraduate Student

We welcome motivated undergraduates to join our team and develop skills in computational biology and biomedical
data science. Many of the undergraduate mentees are admitted to and continued their research in top-notch graduate schools 
(Stanford, UCLA, Johns-Hopkins).

We are happy to design tailored project ideas for undergraduates to cultivate their research interests and learn
practical statistics and programming skils, with opportunities to publish first-author papers in top journals, and
 present their work at prestigious international academic conferences.

*Remote and hybrid working options are possible due to the computational nature of our work.*

Please contact **{{ page.contact }}** to discuss research opportunities.

<a id="high-school-intern"></a>
#### High-School Intern

We also welcome talented high school students to do an internship in the lab. 
We have had fruitful experiences in mentoring high-school students to compete in national science 
competitions ([Top 40 National Finalists in Regeneron STS 2022](https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts/2022-finalists/)).

The high school intern positions are currently filled. Please check back later.

We will design independent research projects for high-school interns aiming to compete in national science competitions, 
with opportunities to publish first-author papers in top journals, and present their own work at prestigious
international academic conferences, similar to undergraduates and graduent students.

*Remote and hybrid working options are possible due to the computational nature of our work.*
