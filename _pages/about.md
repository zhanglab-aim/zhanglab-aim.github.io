Welcome to the Zhang Lab of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine! 

Our lab uses statistical learning and deep learning as the unifying language to communicate 
across research areas in computational biology. 
Currently the primary research interests include:

1. **Automated Deep Learning (AutoDL)-powered Interpretation of Genetic Variations** 

    We develop <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00316-z" target=_blank>AutoDL</a> techniques to accommodate the rapid biotechnology
    development with modern deep learning. These automated, data-driven models help us
    understand the causal effects of genetic variations in various contexts, including 
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00316-z" target=_blank>epigenetics</a>, 
    <a href="https://nips.cc/virtual/2023/75771" target=_blank>transcription</a>, 
    <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/Supplement_1/i342/6319668" target=_blank>genome editing</a>, 
    and in tumors.
    In the long term, we hope our methods will democratize deep learning and thereby accelerate scientific discoveries in biomedicine.

2. **Post-transcriptional and Transcriptional Regulatory Network**

    We also study the molecular mechanisms that mediate the genetic effects to phenotypical variations and disease
    prognostics. Enabled by high-throughput sequencing technologies, we characterize the variation of 
    <a href="https://nips.cc/virtual/2023/75771" target=_blank>RNA expression</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0351-9" target=_blank>RNA splicing</a>, 
    <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/16/9260/4077049" target=_blank>RNA-protein interactions</a>,
    and 
    <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1394-4" target=_blank>RNA modifications</a> 
    in health and disease by quantitative, statistical and deep learning approaches.
